function G = coordGrouping(coords, diameter, overlap, shape)
    % COORDGROUPING  Form groups of coordinates based on definitions.
    %   G = coordGrouping(coords, diameter, overlap, shape) generates groups.
    %   INPUTS
    %   coordinates : a n-by-d matrix of coordinates, or a cell array of such
    %                 matrices. If a cell array is provided, groups are formed
    %                 with respect to the complete set of coordinates, across
    %                 all cells, and then sorted out by coordinate cell. This
    %                 ensures that
    %   diameter    : the distance across shape along each axis. If only one
    %                 diameter is provided, it will apply to all d axes. If
    %                 diameter is zero, groups will each include a single
    %                 voxel.
    %   overlap     : the amount that each group should overlap.
    %   shape       : can be either "cube" or "sphere", although technically
    %                 elipsoids and cuboids are possible by specifying
    %                 different diameters along each dimension.
    %   OUTPUTS
    %   G : A matrix of cells, where rows correspond to groups and there is a
    %       column for each cell of coordinates provided. Each cell contains
    %       indexes that point to rows in the corresponding cell of coords.
