This directory contains all the external packages that my various
toolboxes require. Some are ready to use but others require some
preparation/installation on your machine. The details are below.

---------------------------------------------------------------
1) libsvm (requires MATLAB) - DO NOT DO THIS IF LIBSVM IS ALREADY ON YOUR PATH
- unzip libsvm.zip 
- cd libsvm
- find out the path where MATLAB is installed in your system.
  If you don't know it, type
  - which matlab (will tell you what the matlab executable is)
  - ls -l <matlab executable> (just cut and paste what "which matlab" returns)
  - if this is a symbolic link, it will tell you where the real executable
    is installed; if not, that is the path you want
- edit Makefile and replace

  MATLABDIR ?= /usr/local/matlab

  with

  MATLABDIR ?= <MATLAB path>

  as the libsvm Makefile needs to know where MATLAB is
  (you can also use octave, but I won't cover that here).
- type Make
- if this finished without errors, you should be able to type
  
  ls *.mexglx

  and see

  read_sparse.mexglx  svmpredict.mexglx  svmtrain.mexglx
